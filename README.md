# About
This is a small package to provide basic utilities for creating CLI applications that
are screen reader friendly.  The current aim is to support

| OS      | Screen Reader | Terminal   |
| ---     | ---           | ---        |
| Windows | JAWS          | PowerShell |
| Ubuntu  | Orca          | Terminal   |

The hope is that this application will work for any terminal that is compliant with 
ANSI escape codes, but these are the only 2 where dedicated testing efforts will be 
carried out.
